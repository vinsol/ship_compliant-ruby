module ShipCompliant
  # == ShipCompliant::CheckCompliance
  #
  # The CheckComplianceOfSalesOrderWithAddressValidation API method is used for
  # real time compliance checks from the order point of entry (eCommerce, POS).
  #
  # The method can do three things in one call:
  #
  # - Calculate Sales Tax Due for order and return product level tax rates
  #   (IncludeSalesTaxRates = true)
  # - Validate the ShipTo address and get normalized address result
  # - Check compliance of the order
  #
  # This method takes requires specific order information from the order point
  # of entry for ShipCompliant to check the order for compliance.  The sales
  # order will not be committed via this method.  This API call is usually
  # paired with CommitSalesOrder() to save the sales order to ShipCompliant.
  #
  # Look at the following example request: http://git.io/xMNOvw
  class CheckComplianceOfAndCommitSalesOrder

    # Checks the compliance of a sales order from the data specified.
    #
    # An example of all the required fields can be seen here: http://git.io/xMNOvw

    #     include_sales_tax_rates: true,
    #     # ...
    #   })
